For my capstone project, I wanted to build a tool to help people visualize the ecoregions of California. When learning about the different regions of California, its easy to feel overwhelmed; the state is uniquely diverse in its ecology, geography, and wildlife. Additionally, after moving to Berkeley, I was exposed to people from across the state, and I was often unsure where they were from. My capstone project is an interactive map that details the natural history and ecology of each of California's ecoregions while also showcasing notable areas/landmarks. Interactive maps serve as user-friendly tools for students of any age to explore and learn about the world around them. Below are the sources used.
